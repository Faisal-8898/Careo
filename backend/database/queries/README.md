## Overview

This folder contains SQL queries designed to extract provenance information from the healthcare database. These queries demonstrate the three types of provenance: Why, Where, and How.

## Files

- `provenance_queries.sql` - Complete set of provenance analysis queries
- `why_provenance.sql` - Queries for justification and reasoning
- `where_provenance.sql` - Queries for data lineage and source
- `how_provenance.sql` - Queries for transformation history

## Provenance Types

### Why Provenance (Justification)
