# Healthcare Database Trigger Summary

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of all triggers implemented in the Healthcare Patient Record Management System for automatic provenance tracking and business logic enforcement.

## Trigger Categories

### 1. Audit Triggers (Provenance Tracking)

**Purpose**: Automatically capture all data changes for compliance, audit trails, and provenance tracking.

#### Core Entity Audit Triggers

- **`trg_audit_patients`** - Tracks all patient data changes
- **`trg_audit_doctors`** - Tracks all doctor data changes
- **`trg_audit_nurses`** - Tracks all nurse data changes
- **`trg_audit_admins`** - Tracks all admin data changes
- **`trg_audit_medications`** - Tracks all medication data changes

#### Transaction Audit Triggers

- **`trg_audit_medical_records`** - Tracks all medical record changes
- **`trg_audit_prescriptions`** - Tracks all prescription changes
- **`trg_audit_lab_results`** - Tracks all lab result changes
- **`trg_audit_appointments`** - Tracks all appointment changes

#### Reference Audit Triggers

- **`trg_audit_specializations`** - Tracks all specialization changes
- **`trg_audit_departments`** - Tracks all department changes

### 2. Cascade Triggers (Business Logic)

**Purpose**: Enforce business rules and automatically update related records when status changes occur.

#### Status-Based Cascade Triggers

- **`trg_cascade_medication_status`** - Discontinues active prescriptions when medication is discontinued
- **`trg_cascade_doctor_status`** - Cancels appointments and archives records when doctor is suspended/inactive
- **`trg_cascade_nurse_status`** - Archives medical records when nurse is suspended/inactive
- **`trg_cascade_admin_status`** - Logs security alerts for high-privilege admin status changes
- **`trg_cascade_patient_status`** - Cancels appointments and archives records when patient is deceased
- **`trg_cascade_medical_record_status`** - Cancels prescriptions when medical record is archived/deleted

#### Compliance and Alert Triggers

- **`trg_cascade_prescription_status`** - Logs prescription status changes for compliance tracking
- **`trg_cascade_lab_result_status`** - Logs critical lab results for immediate attention

#### Validation Triggers

- **`trg_cascade_appointment_validation`** - Validates appointment business rules (doctor/patient status, scheduling conflicts)

## Trigger Features

### Audit Trigger Capabilities

- **Operation Tracking**: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations
- **Context Capture**: User ID, session ID, IP address, application name
- **Change Detection**: Identifies specific fields that changed
- **Before/After Values**: Captures old and new values for all fields
- **Provenance Metadata**: Source system, data lineage, transformation notes
- **Compliance Fields**: Compliance level, retention period, legal hold status

### Cascade Trigger Capabilities

- **Automatic Updates**: Updates related records based on status changes
- **Business Rule Enforcement**: Prevents invalid operations
- **Audit Logging**: Logs all cascade effects for traceability
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling without failing main operations
- **Security Monitoring**: Special handling for high-privilege operations

## Data Flow Examples

### Example 1: Medication Discontinuation

1. User updates medication status to 'DISCONTINUED'
2. `trg_cascade_medication_status` automatically cancels all active prescriptions
3. `trg_audit_medications` logs the medication change
4. `trg_audit_prescriptions` logs prescription cancellations
5. `trg_cascade_medication_status` logs cascade effect in user actions

### Example 2: Doctor Suspension

1. User updates doctor status to 'SUSPENDED'
2. `trg_cascade_doctor_status` cancels future appointments
3. `trg_cascade_doctor_status` archives active medical records
4. All changes are logged in respective audit tables
5. Cascade effect is logged in user actions

### Example 3: Appointment Creation

1. User creates new appointment
2. `trg_cascade_appointment_validation` validates:
   - Doctor exists and is active
   - Patient exists and is active
   - Appointment time is in the future
   - No scheduling conflicts
3. If validation passes, appointment is created
4. `trg_audit_appointments` logs the creation

## Compliance and Security Features

### Audit Trail Completeness

- **100% Coverage**: Every table has corresponding audit trigger
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All field changes are tracked
- **Context Preservation**: User, session, and system context maintained
- **Temporal Tracking**: Precise timestamps for all operations

### Business Rule Enforcement

- **Referential Integrity**: Automatic cascade updates maintain data consistency
- **Status Validation**: Prevents invalid status transitions
- **Conflict Prevention**: Prevents double-booking and scheduling conflicts
- **Security Monitoring**: Special alerts for high-privilege operations

### Data Lineage

- **Source Tracking**: Identifies system and user responsible for changes
- **Change Justification**: Captures reasons for modifications
- **Transformation History**: Tracks how data evolved over time
- **Compliance Reporting**: Supports regulatory and audit requirements

## Performance Considerations

### Trigger Optimization

- **Efficient Field Detection**: Only tracks fields that actually changed
- **Minimal Overhead**: Triggers designed for minimal performance impact
- **Error Isolation**: Trigger errors don't affect main operations
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient handling of multiple affected records

### Indexing Strategy

- **Audit Table Indexes**: Optimized for common query patterns
- **Composite Indexes**: Support multi-field searches
- **Temporal Indexes**: Efficient date/time range queries
- **User Activity Indexes**: Fast user-based audit trail queries

## Maintenance and Monitoring

### Trigger Health Checks

- **Error Logging**: All trigger errors are logged for monitoring
- **Performance Metrics**: Track trigger execution times
- **Audit Table Growth**: Monitor audit table sizes and growth rates
- **Cascade Effect Monitoring**: Track automatic updates and their impact

### Backup and Recovery

- **Audit Data Preservation**: Audit tables support point-in-time recovery
- **Compliance Retention**: Configurable retention periods for audit data
- **Legal Hold Support**: Ability to preserve audit data for legal requirements
- **Archive Strategies**: Long-term storage solutions for audit data

## Summary

The Healthcare Database now has **complete trigger coverage** with:

- **11 Audit Triggers** for comprehensive provenance tracking
- **9 Cascade Triggers** for business logic enforcement
- **100% Table Coverage** - every core table has audit and appropriate cascade triggers
- **Compliance Ready** - meets healthcare regulatory requirements
- **Performance Optimized** - minimal impact on operational performance
